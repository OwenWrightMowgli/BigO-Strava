The following section will simply be a diary of one of the greatest nights of my life. 

Written starting at 7:21 am on a bus leaving San Justo for Mendoza (at least 13 hours of a bus ride away) (also still drunk and without having slept for about 25 hours). 

So basically we went to a restaurant downtown for pizza (argentine pizza, kinda weird and not the greatest but ill take what I can get) and lisos (8.5 ounce glasses of unpasteurized argentine beer - delicious).  Meal was solid, brought a pretty hefty amount of crap vodka with me and chased it with free pops. After that me, Christian Beck and Mike Perry contacted an accordionist that we saw perform the night before to find out what the party scene was like in San Justo.

After a while we met up with him and started walking to the apartment of some guy who he sang with in another group (who we met the night before. He looked just like an Argentine Mel Gibson, so literally only knew him as Mel even though hid name was something starting with a c). Turned out his day job was as a motorcycle mechanic, and his apartment was the second floor of his shop right along the main highway through town. Also btw this guy was 60 years old.

So the four of us had picked up 4 liters of beer on our way there, and he had a table and benches out front where the five of us sat for 2 hours or so. The four of us yungins (the accordionist was only 19) drank 5 liters of beer over that time, just guys bein dudes talking about girls, trucks and what we liked about San Justo. 

After a while Mel said he would take us in his truck to the north part of town where the party was happening. We got in the van and endured some sketchy argentine driving for a few minutes before getting to the club at about 2:30. At this point the party was just starting. We said goodbye to Mel, and just when we got there like 10 other Oles showed up that had been walking around for a while. 

Me and Noah Johnson started boolin with some 30 year old dudes for a while and payed the cover fee. Next part was just a 2 hour blur. I got some super good fruit drink from the bar of the club (it was entirely outside) and left the group of oles entirely. Found a couple groups of Argentine dudes and a group of Argentine girls over the next couple hours, talked and exchanged social media.  Long story short, we left the club-thing at about 5:30 and headed back to the hotel. 

The bus was leaving at 7:00 so I had a perfect ninety minutes to pack up. Now it's 7:40 and I'm chilling on the bus after the hotel breakfast, still feeling pretty drunk and ready for the bus ride. One of the greatest nights of my life. Good night you stupid runners.  ",1765,7081.11,false,,

Overall though I'm pretty stunned that I could hit a workout that hard at the end of my highest mileage week ever. 

Based on the time, if my slows were 7min pace average (a slightly conservative guess w/ accel/decel factored in) that means the fasts averaged 4:45. That probably makes sense given that my quarter split at the start was 69 and by the end they were 73-74. Last few fasts and slows were a lot slower. Mile splits were 5:15-5:28-5:34-5:40-5:43-73(1/4), fast pace per mile was 4:00-3:43-3:34-3:40-3:43, which more or less suggests that the pace was actually pretty even throughout. 

Overall really proud of this workout, best solo summer workout in college. Doing 20 mins of work under 5k pace on the road suggests I'm actually in pretty damn good shape; it was hard but not completely exhausting.

(Long text for my reference to follow) Gonna try out a new system of general race ratings with a simple 0-5 rating. I figure this can help me mentally categorize every race I do to better understand how to react to them in relation to previous races, for better and worse:
0: effectively N/A - DNF for an obvious and physically treatable reason (7/4/2017 10k - arch and shin problems, DNF
1: Very disappointing - need for training reevaluation and major refocus (XC regionals 2017, Indoor conference 2018)

2: Dissatisfying - indicative of some need to refocus (LaX and Eau Claire 2017)

3: Satisfying - headed in the right direction, need to focus in on racing tactics and other minor details (XC conference 2017)

4: Motivating - right in line with the trajectory towards my biggest goals (DKM2KCR 2017, Tommie Showcase 2018)

5: Unprecedented improvement - ""what just happened"" moment (MIAC Outdoor 1500 2016, MIAC Indoor 3000 2017) 

This summer I've hit 3's on the Memorial day 5k and the Fourth of July 10k, and a 4 on Detweiller at Dark. I'm due for a 5 at some point this season, but if I continue to hit 4's I think I'll be in position to get AA without even needing a 5.

1765449392,2018-08-11 15:00:08,2018 Deerfield Alumni run - a close call but got the W,Run,"First off time doesn't matter even a little bit, the coach who always measures the course is notoriously inaccurate. Also the course went on more pavement than ever and we got sent around a tree in some deep brush and almost tripped going around both times. 

The field was much deeper than ever, 13x winner Jeff Bailey was back and gave me a run for my money, he was 5 seconds back. He won it his first time in 2000 and has won every year that he has raced since, so this was his first time not winning, including against many D1 athletes. 

Alumni won the race finishing 1-2-4-5-6 which was good, also the women's winner was the 2002 FootLocker HS champ Erika Odlaug. Overall reasonably happy, a more impressive run than last year but not as good as Det@dark. 

I'll give this baby a 3 - not bad but not great. ",615,3218.7,false,,
