2017-06-21 02:11:20,"I took it off for the race because you reminded me of it, otherwise I probably wouldn't have thought to.  It will be back "
2017-06-21 03:22:04,"I won't make it this week, but don't count it out for the future "

2017-07-13 02:24:13,"Haha don't apologize, you got yourself to look after, I was doing the same when I was in front "
