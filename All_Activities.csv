Really good race. Felt like I was in a good grove throughout most of it. Definitely hurt towards the end. Got out in the middle of the second chase pack and slowly moved up to the front of it through the first mile. Always great having the parade route cheering all the way through downtown. Hit the mile in 4:56. Didn't expect it to be that fast as it didn't feel that fast and the leaders had at least 20seconds on me. Kept moving up with the goal of beating juggz in mind. The 180 turn through me for a loop as always. Not good at reaccelerating after that. Hit the 2 mile in about 10:08. Then it started to feel worse. Still no one was really passing me though which was strange. As we go to the stone arch bridge I realized I had a chance to beat juggz and got to about 30m behind him with 300 to go, But surprise surprise he through down a nasty kick and dusted me. I'll get him at alumni. 
Rumor was the course was short. It's hard to imagine they measured it short but just short enough to be an issue, so my working hypothesis is that they measured the tangents weird and thus it was a little short for someone who was actually running the course. Or the skyscrapers screwed up GPS watches, which is possible. Either way I probably ran 5:00-5:05 pace and felt smooth. This is also probably 30seconds faster than last year, so the training is working.

Felt so much better in this workout than I have since about last Monday. Nice to know that a couple days of just getting in a groove again both in terms of school work and running are all my body needed. Drank tea before the workout as a boost and I think it totally helped, will continue to do through the season. Just felt like I could go on forever today.

Went prairie to shit shack and back for each rep. Reps coming back were much harder than going out due to wind and hills.

Holy cow! Could tell things were going to be good here the whole day. Felt really good the last couple days and that extended to the warm up. Felt like my legs were super loose and full of energy (TY caffeine). The way workouts have been going, I've really just been waiting for the opportunity to go for it. Got out hard up the hill and almost tripped, which would have been a real fun start to the race, but thankfully didn't. Pack found each other at about 1K. And we started rolling, The stout pack was right next to us and I think we got a little antsy with them near us but we didn't go to hard. 4:59 through the mile and it still felt like we were cruising. Carleton went out classically hard and we worked our way up to Wilkenson and stayed with him through the two mile in 10:01. At this point we caught back up to Cathy and he began to ""coach"" us through the next mile, which while being classic cathy did help me to stay in contact with Wilkenson and Primo/Bill/Turtle. Kept moving up through the 5k in 15:49. 1 second off of my track 5K PR (definitely looking to improve upon that in track season lol). At this point i've been in enough 8ks that I kind of now how the last 3k should feel and I just tried to feel strong and maintain pace until the last .5 mile. Probably slowed up a little but overall felt like I maintained pretty well. Wilkenson and I at this point kept going back and forth, where I would catch him and he would surge up for about 10 steps. Got to 7k in 22:24 and thought how It was finally my chance to break 26:00 lol. flew up the last hill and past wilky thinking that would be the last time as he looked dead. Absolutely flew down the hill towards Primo (flashbacks to pre-camp long run)(Love racing with this dude) and caught him with about 200m to go, Opposite of last years race where he did this to me. As i passed him, Wilkenson caught me and moved past, did everything to pass him that I could and was thinking back to my broken wrist, which I attribute at least slightly to him and Burgstahler. sadly couldn't pull him, but I will get him at conference. I have to. Finish 25:24. a 58s PR. Gang. Keep rolling. Happy but not satisfied. I really want this team to win a fucking meet. We deserve it but keep faltering in the last 3K. I guess we'll shoot for of the next three. Will be really fun to have another shot at LaCrosse in 2 weeks, sounds like they are ready to roll!
Loved hearing parents remark at our pack: ""wow that's a lot of that team""
Really happy seeing so many guys PR too, probably one of my most rewarding times hanging out after the finish line. Oct 27/Nov 17

Got out kind of slow at least compared to the rest of the field and got trapped on the inside of a big pack and was getting pushed around a lot, sorry Rubis. Could see the rest of our boys in front of me and bided my time and slowly worked through the group and made it back up to them. Screw the Augustana guys for literally making a wall of 6 guys and slowing up, and not letting people through. Really annoying for a race in early October. Mile split was about 5:00 and the first hill felt good just kind of cruised up it which still meant passing people. Picked it up for the downhill with Plumb and caught ChrisB and Primo at about 3K. We stayed together as a pack + Elliot and SoggDogg until 5k. At that point Cathy said we were beating LAX which was sick, but I could tell at least by how I felt at this point that it was going to be a survival last 3k and not a moving up. Fell of Plumb and ChrisB by a few seconds but kept them in striking distance. I know i always have a little more the last K than most people do and kind of counted on that, but also should have just stayed with them. I always allows myself to end up in NoMan's land - need to work on that. 2 LAX guys came on my shoulder with 1K to go and that really got me going. I moved up to ChrisB and Plumb at this point and started moving up the hill. Holy Shit am i glad I don't have to run that hill again. Hauled Ass down the last 600 but ChrisB's prediction from strides yesterday came true and he surged past me in the last 50m. Didn't care so much about that as I did that those two LAX guys got me at this point too. really would have liked to gotten them and kept the score alittle closer. overall 30 points behind LAX and having the pack we did are huge upsides for the championship aparts of the season. Even if one guys goes down, we have 5more right there. Hyped to be a part of this team and psyched to have three more races with these guys. Phil set the prediction that we will beat LAX at Nats. If we do that, then there is no reason we wouldn't be a podium team. First and foremost is getting our team back there and being top 10, but I do truly believe that if we all click on that day that we could be on the podium!

Honestly pretty pleased with this race despite not great time. Course was wet and overall didn't run fast top to bottom. Could definitely still feel the workout from tuesday in my legs which sucks because I've really been emphasizing feeling good for races instead of hitting workouts hard this year, overall I'm happy but nowhere near satisifed and ready to smack Conference really good. Also we got moved to #1 in the regional rankings, which I don't like, would rather we were still sitting at #2 and hiding in the shadows.

Legs didn't feel good on warmup or staring the workout and my stomach was kind of tossing  but somehow running 5:05 pace felt very manageable. Phil wanted us to stay in check so we slowed down a little and tried to focus on good form instead of any sort of splits. Gonna take the next few days really easy to get my legs back to 100% as they don't feel great right now and i need to focus on feeling good instead of hitting workouts hard at this point of the season.

Need to keep the group in line the next few weeks and make sure everyone is recovering properly, and sleeping enough. There's nothing stopping us from hitting our goals this year except ourselves",2685,11585.7,7.2005593536358,44.75,6.21479496275581,"3",936

Just not any energy and even though the motivation was there to keep moving up my legs wouldn't respond.

For example, butters had a good day, soggy and butch both had great days coming through for the team. Got too caught up in my performance and forgot to cheer on the boys which is what its all about.

Sadly, because the logarun phone interface is such ass, and I'm not bringing a computer, I'll be switching over to strava for the next 8 weeks. I will go back to logarun once in the states, as it is vastly superior, but there is no app so strava it is. Have no idea what training is gonna be like there, hopefully I can get a decent amount in.

Also, since I last logged, I have switched over to running in ""badger miles"". I didn't want to bring my gps watch to guatemala in fear that it would be stolen, so I switched over to a 10 dollar target watch that just tracks time. Badger miles work on the premise that you run 7:30 pace all the time (at least for me, the bubs at wisco do 7:00 pace). If you want to know more about it, google it. Letsrun has a ton on it. But for me, here it is:

1 mile- 10 minutes
2 miles- 15 minutes
3 miles- 25 minutes
4 miles- 30 minutes
5 miles- 40 minutes
6 miles- 45 minutes
7 miles- 55 minutes
8 miles- 60 minutes

and so on. Now, the log for today:

Got up today and did a bunch of stuff to prep for guatemala, so didn't run til 12:30. Wicked hot and sunny out, so I ran slow and easy. OAB on the canal past fletchers boathouse for 60 minutes. Saw my bub prom date from a year ago on the way back, lol she just put her head down and ignored me. Filthy. Absolutely filthy. Did 4 minute plank, some other core exercises, and pedestal x10.

Pedestal x15, 30 push-ups, 20 calf raises, hip strength, 2 min wall sit w band, balance, and rolling out right calf which has been tight. Also used this time to read about plyos and short hill strides, both of which I’m considering implementing in my training. Gonna start really small: once a week 6x 10-15 second hill stride, once a week 6x regular 15-20 second stride, once a week 10x squat jump, 10x box jump, 10x step up, 15x double leg short hops, and 10x single leg squats on one of my harder/longer days.

Pm: after class the family told me we were gonna go to the top of a mountain on the outskirts of town. They also told me I was gonna run up it, if I wanted. Had no idea how high it was, so I grabbed my camelback and was prepared for a 3 hour run. Turned out to be 85, but it was tough. Going up the whole way, no break. I probably gained something like 4000 feet, cuz I started around 8000 and finished just around 1200. My Achilles  are killing me. It was a ton of fun to change up the type of running i do, and I now have a newfound respect for ultra bubs. But it was tough, took a walk break every ten minutes or so to give my calves a rest.

Was feeling really good around 40 minutes and was gonna try and do 100 for 13, but I looked left and saw huge storm clouds rolling at me exactly in the direction I had to run back to get home. Turned at 45 and saw three huge lightning bolts strike a few miles in front, in the direction I was headed. Was kinda fitting lol cuz both “promised land” and “badlands” by Bruce were stuck in my head the whole way. So I turned up the tempo and pushed to get back. Made it alive, but it was easily one of the scariest runs I’ve been on in a very long time, especially coming over the mountain after having seen lighting close by. Was kinda a bummer too, because I was feeling really good at the flip and had good rhythm going, but I was focused on the storm and not running on the way back so it just felt choppy and strange. Oh well, I like running at this time though, much better than early am when I always get the shits. Also, had some right shin pain that went away after 15 minutes or so. This always happens when I start serious training, just gonna keep and eye on it.

Before bed I did core: 3 min wall sit w band, band walks, balance, 15 minute core workout, jumps (10x squat jump, box jump, step up, single leg squat, 15x double leg hops), 30 push-ups, and stretched and rolled especially right calf.",5400,19312.2,12.0026103169671,90,7.49836890670146,"1",370

Kev had OCS family day in the morning and family dinner in the pm so had to do this in DC summer heat. Strated out hammering a bit and then settled. Took a nap after we got home from Quantico and then pounded coffee before run to wake up so that's why the start is fast, settled after I worked the caffeine out.

Overall though I'm pretty stunned that I could hit a workout that hard at the end of my highest mileage week ever. 

Based on the time, if my slows were 7min pace average (a slightly conservative guess w/ accel/decel factored in) that means the fasts averaged 4:45. That probably makes sense given that my quarter split at the start was 69 and by the end they were 73-74. Last few fasts and slows were a lot slower. Mile splits were 5:15-5:28-5:34-5:40-5:43-73(1/4), fast pace per mile was 4:00-3:43-3:34-3:40-3:43, which more or less suggests that the pace was actually pretty even throughout. 

Overall really proud of this workout, best solo summer workout in college. Doing 20 mins of work under 5k pace on the road suggests I'm actually in pretty damn good shape; it was hard but not completely exhausting.

(Long text for my reference to follow) Gonna try out a new system of general race ratings with a simple 0-5 rating. I figure this can help me mentally categorize every race I do to better understand how to react to them in relation to previous races, for better and worse:
0: effectively N/A - DNF for an obvious and physically treatable reason (7/4/2017 10k - arch and shin problems, DNF
1: Very disappointing - need for training reevaluation and major refocus (XC regionals 2017, Indoor conference 2018)

2: Dissatisfying - indicative of some need to refocus (LaX and Eau Claire 2017)

3: Satisfying - headed in the right direction, need to focus in on racing tactics and other minor details (XC conference 2017)

4: Motivating - right in line with the trajectory towards my biggest goals (DKM2KCR 2017, Tommie Showcase 2018)

5: Unprecedented improvement - ""what just happened"" moment (MIAC Outdoor 1500 2016, MIAC Indoor 3000 2017) 

This summer I've hit 3's on the Memorial day 5k and the Fourth of July 10k, and a 4 on Detweiller at Dark. I'm due for a 5 at some point this season, but if I continue to hit 4's I think I'll be in position to get AA without even needing a 5.
