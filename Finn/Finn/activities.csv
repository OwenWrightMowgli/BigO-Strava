Shin felt great on the warm up but got worse during the workout. Might be the flats. After the run I did blitzkrieg x15, and then a ton of band/stretching/rolling w a tennis ball/balance stuff to work on my leg. I hope it goes away soon. Earlier today I did about 20 minutes rolling my calf and foot with a tennis ball, as well as stretching my soleus. In the past my soleus has given me issue, so monitoring that. That really helped before the run. I'm for sure gonna take a down week this week, down to 50-55 with a planned off day tomorrow. Talking to cathy convinced me of that. Since last week was my highest mileage ever, it wouldn't be smart to do an even higher mile week this week. I'll bike instead, and depending on how it's doing thursday might take another cross train day. Not ideal, but better to stay healthy. Also gotta keep icing.

Checked heart rate after 5 minute and it was 154 bpm so that's perfect. Good cardio. Was listening to one of the phish shows from their new year's run. Listened to a whole 2 songs in the hour (didn't finish the second song), classic jam bands. After the bike I did pedestal x15, a lot of band work with a stronger band then I've been using, a lot of hip strength, balance, 20 eccentrics on each leg, rolled with a tennis ball, hip loosening, then pullups, 4x25 pushups, and 4x10 lunges for recovery on pushups. Good day. Will warm up for workout tomorrow to see how it is, would like to do the workout if it feels good. Hopefully it's just my chronic shin splints acting up. Late last night when I should have been doing greatcon, I looked back on my log from senior year. A similar thing happened like this where my shin started acting bad in mid-february. Of course I assumed the worst then, thinking my stress fracture had happened again. But after some time down and a lot of pt it went away, so hoping that happens again this time.

Then, in the distance, at the intersection for the turnoff to Bryce, we see PT. He apparently decided to wait for us, but Smelliot and I commence joking about how he will immediately drop us. But then, behind PT, a figure appears. He is dressed in jeans, a black jack, a black head cover, and gloves. It appeared to be just an old man out for a walk. But as we get closer, someone in the group half-joking says ""Griff?"". Then, with about 50 meters to go, we realized: It IS Griff!!!!! As we approach, the first words out of his mouth are: ""So where is Dr. Ellenbacker?"", causing child-like laughter all around the group.

Cross campus cool down.

Felt really good on the workout today. Really good. The reps felt easy and I recovered really fast between them, probably as a result of some higher mileage weeks. Body adapted quickly. On the reps I tried to focus on running fast while staying relaxed. Tried to use as little motion as possible up top. Really good day, think I'll come back well from this to absolutely shrek the 10x400.

After workout I did pedestal and bataan x12, as well as 12 minutes of core. Stretched extensively after this. Then a really fun team dinner at Carleton, where I had to show up wilkinson and destroyed them in a shotgun race. Bubs came in acting weird then challenged us so I couldn't let them show us up.

1505312360,2018-04-12 22:30:00,Season Opener +tempo,Run,"3 mile warm up, only to stand around and stay loose for a while because the stupid Tommies couldn't run a race correctly. Raced 35 minutes later than I was supposed to. Not to mention it got significantly colder from when I warmed up to when I raced, so that wasn't fun. 

Ran a 2:04 low I think. Jrue took the race from the gun and kept the pace honest while cutting into the wind, so kudos to him. Came through 400 in about 61/62 I think. Felt really good the 3rd 200 and started to make a move on the backstretch when Matt Paal blew by me. Hung on but then got to the home stretch and my legs just felt like straight up lead. I couldn't move them at all. Faded hard that 100. Overall, I am very happy with today. My legs felt really tired on the warm up, as to be expected, so I figured I'd go out conservatively and see what happened. Did just that and it went as well as I could expect.

Given I haven't really done any serious speed work, I think this is a good race. I've got solid leg speed right now, and I think the mileage and strength will bode well for a fast 1500/5k later in the season. This was a really good rust buster. Would have liked to be closer to that 2 flat/sub 2, but I think once I cut the mileage and hit the track more I will do that comfortably.

After the race I did a 5.3 mile cool down with a 16 minute tempo at 5:40 pace. Did ten minutes, took about a minute down, then started up again but legs felt heavy so I cut it a little short. Still a good effort, longest tempo run I've done in a while which is exciting. Pedestal x10 and some light stretching after.

Now I need to make sure I smack a decent amount of sleep tonight so that I can recover well from a big effort day.

Also, some awesome efforts by the team today. I think this was a much better season opener for the team than the Tommie opener was for indoor. We look much healthier and guys are running well again. Let's keep that going and roll the filthy carls in 4 weeks!",5400,17702.8,false,,

I don't think I will run well anyways due to a big week of training, but I think I might surprise myself and put down something decent. There really isn't a reason for me to go ""all out"" tomorrow, so I think that's what I'm gonna do and just see what happens.

Was snowing pretty hard during this which was pretty fun haha. Phil was watching and he told us to keep it around 50 for the 300s, I think because of the weather he just wanted us to get some effort in and not worry about pace at all, have us hold back a bit. Well, paces were all over the place lol due to wind changes and it being pretty hard to estimate pace due to weather. Hit the 300s in 50, 49, 52, 51, and the 200s in 33, 32, 32, 31.

This week I’ll be able to train, but on Saturday I’m traveling to Antigua and will be on the move for the first two weeks in July. Don’t think I’ll be training a ton, I’m not a fan of running in areas I don’t know well down here due to high rates of violence and gang activity. So I’ll try to run as much as possible those two weeks but it won’t be ideal. Still, it’ll be an awesome experience. I can run the rest of my life, but not travel.

From Cathy I got the following:
- increase number of strides per week. I’m running slower than usual due to altitude and mountains, so strides should be more often to keep up foot rate.
- Gonna do a workout this week since idk about next two.
- hill sprints twice a week. Gonna switch to two sessions of 4 rather than one of 6 for now. 10-12 seconds up, full recovery on way down.
- jumps: gonna keep it once a week, 35-40 foot contacts per. Goal will be to build to twice a week, 50-60 contacts per but we’ll see if I get there by end of summer. Also, gonna add in single leg distance jumps (very few bc injury risk) and lunge jumps.

Kev had OCS family day in the morning and family dinner in the pm so had to do this in DC summer heat. Strated out hammering a bit and then settled. Took a nap after we got home from Quantico and then pounded coffee before run to wake up so that's why the start is fast, settled after I worked the caffeine out.

Hip was slightly sore starting around mile 3. Never got bad, but wasn't great either. Might have something to do with bio lab today. We had to do 10 minutes of exercise so I just ran down to the track, did a fast mile in about 5:10, and ran back up. Running fast with no warm up might've been part of the reason my hip was sore today, it's cold out and without a warmup the muscles probably contracted to make it stiff. Still did a lot of work on strength in hips, core, and rolling/massage to work on some of the scar tissue there. Gonna take tomorrow off and then try to run again friday.

Felt good, hammered a little on the first mile then reined it in to a more appropriate tempo effort given current fitness. Can't let myself be hammering workouts and tempos and stuff like that, gotta be reasonable in my training. Hip felt fine today, a little tight at start but loosened up.

Go back out and started tempo again, having readjusted my goal to be 2x10 minute tempo with a short shit break in between. Got through 5 minutes this time before stopping the watch to run for the bushes! Jogged it in to the casey's general store where I got a lot out, then to the holiday where I finished the job. Back up the hill to skog where I went twice more. It's been liquid, so I think I ate something in the caf. Kinda sucks because I had pretty much stopped having bowel problems after a few weeks ago when I changed my eating strategies. ",4500,15610.6,false,,
