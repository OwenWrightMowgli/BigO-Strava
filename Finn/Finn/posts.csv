Arrived Sunday at 12am after leaving the states around 3:30am Saturday. Slept for most of Sunday, and didn’t have much opportunity to run or figure out where to run. The locals don’t run at all. There are a few gyms, but it is all weight lifting. They get exercise from playing soccer. So I was on my own to figure out where to train. Today I was taking class for most of the day, but in the afternoon I had the chance to go for a long walk from where I am staying on the outskirts of the city. I walked out on some country roads towards the mountains. That’s really all there is out here. Really nice area and now that I’ve walked there I feel safe enough to run there. Will run tomorrow morning. I will add a few photos to show how sick the running out here is gonna be.","",photos/1252A32D-8D0F-44C4-8AA0-A4A1A7FAC432.jpg|photos/3A8B7067-E0A9-43F0-9B59-D69BE046624E.jpg|photos/54784F52-FB1B-4205-AFEB-49BF9B61A08B.jpg|photos/E0BB0C31-CCD8-47D1-A0CA-32A2244E084D.jpg|photos/6B9CA489-79D2-4397-AFD9-E213FB28558B.jpg|photos/7C4D3B55-92C6-4C71-BD32-A2877D5669EB.jpg|photos/EBC4F1CE-4C0C-46FE-99B0-C82801C14674.jpg|photos/CA2B4BD6-3DB5-4936-B9F4-5E0B6522EF22.jpg|photos/200D953F-CACD-4616-B8E6-91EE7C63C940.jpg
2018-04-04 03:33:28,Update,"Don't feel like carrying my log over from logarun for the past ~1.5 weeks so I'll summarize quickly. OSR kinda screwed me in terms of training, only hit 37.5 miles after 70 the week before. So pretty bummed on that end. Got in some kinda workouts but not solid ones. I only had 30 minutes a day to train, an hour at most, so shit was limited. 2 days completely off, not by choice. But am ready to get back after it.","",""
