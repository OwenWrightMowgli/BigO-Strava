20 min tempo: 3.66 miles @ 5:25-5:30 pace HR avg = 150 

2.84 mi CD

Decided to do long tempo for workout this week. Felt good first halfmile as i worked into the pace and then i was rolling. Felt pretty relaxed through the whole thing, and my avg heart rate being only 150 shows that. Beat my brothers 16:33 3 mile pr during this lol. Pace may have been a little closer to 5:20 given a turn around  and had to stop for 10 seconds for traffic, which kind of threw me out of a groove but it was fine, but effort is more important than the number my watch tells me.
Really pleased with how this went since i definetly dread long tempos and was dreading it during the WU

Good Steeple Opener,
Warmed up with dynamic drills + trail leg exercises + one hurdle.
Race started and I went to lead through 200 in about 35. First couple hurdles felt kind of clumsy as they normally do. First water barrier was good as well. 2nd water barrier almost had to walk over. Bakken was right about the fact that when the board beneath the barrier is gone then it is really hard to gage the barrier. After two laps I kind of got in a groove at about 78s with Anders Rasmussen and felt really good over most of the barriers and was seeing and clearing them really well. With about 600 to go I lost steam and Rasmussen pulled away, wish I could have found energy to stay with him as I really wanted to be sub 9:50, but I can't complain in a 12 second PR and opener. 
Definitely need to practice actual water barriers, I only ever got one foot wet, including the almost walk over one, but I still felt like I was jarring myself on the landing and would lose time on Rasmussen at that point, which I would make up over the next few barriers. I also need to do workouts that simulate the end of the steeple, I don't feel that the 1500 speed workouts are simulating that, would like to get a hard steeple workout in soon that puts me in the dirt.
I truly believe now that I could go sub 9:30 in the steeple this year and that is the goal. I'll post the link to Crispy's video in here once he has it done! I can beat Rasmussen the next time I see him. I would like to race my next steeple next Friday at Phil Esten to get some top tier competition and see if i can get pulled to a fast time, Phil said ""maybe."" could tell he would rather see me compete at CSP.

Confused I told him to politely fuck off. 800 in 2:14 still felt smooth. Got off my rhythm with that incident though. Kept cruising, At this point Dan was coming back to us and people surged up to him, I was boxed in and couldn't move to the outside so I snuck through the pack and then surged to the outside on the home stretch moving up to about 6th. 1200 in 3:22.

1569686042,2018-05-13 14:50:45,A Lot of Pain to Bring Meaning to My Life (Conference Steeple 8th Place),Run,"Bittersweet Race to be sure. Felt absolutely incredible just cruising along with Rosenau, Wilkinson, Rasmussen, and O'hare. Came through 400 in 72, First water barrier was alright, nothing great, 800  in 2:30. Still felt smooth and not exhausted. Dreaming of a time in the 9:20-9:30s. Came past 1k in 3:08. Then at the second barrier after 1k Burgstahler came whipping around in front of me, Lost my footing about 30m before hurdle, regained footing then hurdled and Burgstahler's trail leg hit my lead leg, my trail leg then smashed into the Barrier sending me straight into the ground. Sprang back up as fast as I could. Lead pack was gone and my Knee instantly was throbbing. Was determined to bring meaning to my life though. Bakken passed me the next lap and I decided since I could tell I was going to have a rough second half of the race that I would stick on him. Managed to hang on to him for awhile. Johnnie that I sat on at Mac Twilight passed me with 1k to go, putting me in 9th. Seriously considered dropping out especially after landing on my left leg on one of the water pits that put me in immense pain. Something kept me going, probably adrenaline. Cruised past the Johnnie with 500 to go and didn't look back. Dan came back to me with 50m to go and I coasted in with him and fell onto the barrier immediately. Looked down and my knee was already the size of a grapefruit, and my wrist began to throb. Tried walking back over to my stuff on the other side of the track and knew I wouldn't be able to get over there. Looked for Colton and couldn't find him. He found me and brought me back to feel up my knee and wrist. Scary part was he told me that he thought I fractured my patella... Thankfully after 2 hours in the hospital later that night, Found out that I ""severely contused my knee and possibly broke my wrist"" since they can't see a break in the bone that would have broken until a few days after it happens. 
Last 2/3rds of the race were a daze, every step hurt, but I still PR'd and brought meaning to my life. Sadly I know i could have run a lot faster if this hadn't happened. Griff suggested probably 9:30...... Now I have to wait another year to prove I can run that fast and another 4 months to get this sick taste out of my mouth of not having truly hit the goals I wanted too.  Have to take at least 3-4 days off of running, probably more. ",587,3000.0,false,Lightning,

Really good race. Felt like I was in a good grove throughout most of it. Definitely hurt towards the end. Got out in the middle of the second chase pack and slowly moved up to the front of it through the first mile. Always great having the parade route cheering all the way through downtown. Hit the mile in 4:56. Didn't expect it to be that fast as it didn't feel that fast and the leaders had at least 20seconds on me. Kept moving up with the goal of beating juggz in mind. The 180 turn through me for a loop as always. Not good at reaccelerating after that. Hit the 2 mile in about 10:08. Then it started to feel worse. Still no one was really passing me though which was strange. As we go to the stone arch bridge I realized I had a chance to beat juggz and got to about 30m behind him with 300 to go, But surprise surprise he through down a nasty kick and dusted me. I'll get him at alumni. 
Rumor was the course was short. It's hard to imagine they measured it short but just short enough to be an issue, so my working hypothesis is that they measured the tangents weird and thus it was a little short for someone who was actually running the course. Or the skyscrapers screwed up GPS watches, which is possible. Either way I probably ran 5:00-5:05 pace and felt smooth. This is also probably 30seconds faster than last year, so the training is working.

Holy cow! Could tell things were going to be good here the whole day. Felt really good the last couple days and that extended to the warm up. Felt like my legs were super loose and full of energy (TY caffeine). The way workouts have been going, I've really just been waiting for the opportunity to go for it. Got out hard up the hill and almost tripped, which would have been a real fun start to the race, but thankfully didn't. Pack found each other at about 1K. And we started rolling, The stout pack was right next to us and I think we got a little antsy with them near us but we didn't go to hard. 4:59 through the mile and it still felt like we were cruising. Carleton went out classically hard and we worked our way up to Wilkenson and stayed with him through the two mile in 10:01. At this point we caught back up to Cathy and he began to ""coach"" us through the next mile, which while being classic cathy did help me to stay in contact with Wilkenson and Primo/Bill/Turtle. Kept moving up through the 5k in 15:49. 1 second off of my track 5K PR (definitely looking to improve upon that in track season lol). At this point i've been in enough 8ks that I kind of now how the last 3k should feel and I just tried to feel strong and maintain pace until the last .5 mile. Probably slowed up a little but overall felt like I maintained pretty well. Wilkenson and I at this point kept going back and forth, where I would catch him and he would surge up for about 10 steps. Got to 7k in 22:24 and thought how It was finally my chance to break 26:00 lol. flew up the last hill and past wilky thinking that would be the last time as he looked dead. Absolutely flew down the hill towards Primo (flashbacks to pre-camp long run)(Love racing with this dude) and caught him with about 200m to go, Opposite of last years race where he did this to me. As i passed him, Wilkenson caught me and moved past, did everything to pass him that I could and was thinking back to my broken wrist, which I attribute at least slightly to him and Burgstahler. sadly couldn't pull him, but I will get him at conference. I have to. Finish 25:24. a 58s PR. Gang. Keep rolling. Happy but not satisfied. I really want this team to win a fucking meet. We deserve it but keep faltering in the last 3K. I guess we'll shoot for of the next three. Will be really fun to have another shot at LaCrosse in 2 weeks, sounds like they are ready to roll!
Loved hearing parents remark at our pack: ""wow that's a lot of that team""
Really happy seeing so many guys PR too, probably one of my most rewarding times hanging out after the finish line. Oct 27/Nov 17

Got out kind of slow at least compared to the rest of the field and got trapped on the inside of a big pack and was getting pushed around a lot, sorry Rubis. Could see the rest of our boys in front of me and bided my time and slowly worked through the group and made it back up to them. Screw the Augustana guys for literally making a wall of 6 guys and slowing up, and not letting people through. Really annoying for a race in early October. Mile split was about 5:00 and the first hill felt good just kind of cruised up it which still meant passing people. Picked it up for the downhill with Plumb and caught ChrisB and Primo at about 3K. We stayed together as a pack + Elliot and SoggDogg until 5k. At that point Cathy said we were beating LAX which was sick, but I could tell at least by how I felt at this point that it was going to be a survival last 3k and not a moving up. Fell of Plumb and ChrisB by a few seconds but kept them in striking distance. I know i always have a little more the last K than most people do and kind of counted on that, but also should have just stayed with them. I always allows myself to end up in NoMan's land - need to work on that. 2 LAX guys came on my shoulder with 1K to go and that really got me going. I moved up to ChrisB and Plumb at this point and started moving up the hill. Holy Shit am i glad I don't have to run that hill again. Hauled Ass down the last 600 but ChrisB's prediction from strides yesterday came true and he surged past me in the last 50m. Didn't care so much about that as I did that those two LAX guys got me at this point too. really would have liked to gotten them and kept the score alittle closer. overall 30 points behind LAX and having the pack we did are huge upsides for the championship aparts of the season. Even if one guys goes down, we have 5more right there. Hyped to be a part of this team and psyched to have three more races with these guys. Phil set the prediction that we will beat LAX at Nats. If we do that, then there is no reason we wouldn't be a podium team. First and foremost is getting our team back there and being top 10, but I do truly believe that if we all click on that day that we could be on the podium!

Honestly pretty pleased with this race despite not great time. Course was wet and overall didn't run fast top to bottom. Could definitely still feel the workout from tuesday in my legs which sucks because I've really been emphasizing feeling good for races instead of hitting workouts hard this year, overall I'm happy but nowhere near satisifed and ready to smack Conference really good. Also we got moved to #1 in the regional rankings, which I don't like, would rather we were still sitting at #2 and hiding in the shadows.
