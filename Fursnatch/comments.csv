2017-03-26 17:14:36,Luce line!!
2017-03-28 04:10:36,Wow! AM!!!! 
2017-05-26 15:33:45,Thomas complains about running with butters since he picks up the pace too fast. Thomas proceeds to do 6 at 6 flat.
2017-06-04 10:34:43,"Alec Getzloff missed that waterfall because be stayed further north, but trust me I've seen mt fair share of waterfalls here. Haven't seen many kayakers though"
2017-06-06 19:02:14,Explain more?
2017-06-06 20:07:27,"Glad its improving, do pedestal!"
2017-06-07 22:24:35,What type of ducks
2017-06-08 03:09:09,"Relax the pace, no point in stressing it further, i know you need your mile but does it have to be sub-6:40? But glad its getting better!"
2017-06-08 16:34:41,Make it 2 separate activities 
2017-06-08 16:37:36,"The normal route cuts a little earlier and looks better, ill do it sometime soon"
2017-06-09 15:08:33,Wow hope you are ready to keep up with Megan next week 
2017-06-09 15:08:57,That was from Megan Heiniger  
2017-06-11 17:52:22,"Good to see you're running, but with all of these strava activities, im confused to shit"
2017-06-11 17:55:03,"Also glad to see no spooky storms, can atest it was very spooky, make sure to drink your calcium to avoid the spooky storms"
2017-06-12 18:16:49,Where's the pic?
2017-06-13 04:28:14,When did that change?
2017-06-14 20:57:55,Are you fucking with me.....check out my run
2017-06-17 17:06:13,You got to follow him on here 
2017-06-17 17:17:33,He showed up as a companion on my spooky storm run
2017-06-22 04:25:45,"Easy, breezy....covergirl"
2017-06-23 14:55:34,Plz explain why high temps = calf tightness
2017-06-23 15:23:09,"Generally higher temperatures are associated with your muscles being looser, because the heat opens up blood vessels bringing more oxygen and helping to take away lactic acid and thus technically decreasing soreness. which is why most athletes, especially fast twitch muscle athlete's don't need to warm up as much in the heat, and why at physical therapy they put hot pads on you before starting therapy. I would say muscle soreness might be more from trying to maintain the same expected pace or effort in the heat. But i mean who knows muscle soreness can stem from millions of different things, just be sure to not kill yourself for two weeks again pls"
2017-06-25 16:26:33,Fixed 
2017-06-28 04:18:47,"Why the 8x50, speed? or just to loosen up?"
2017-07-01 04:06:43,This is a good guess on time
2017-07-01 04:07:15,This was done in a solid period of time
2017-07-01 19:14:23,Record this as a bike
2017-07-01 19:16:22,Record this as a bike
2017-07-01 19:24:24,"Pace is unrealistic and it is titled as a bike
"
2017-07-01 19:25:30,Unrealistic Pace over activity
2017-07-06 19:44:19,Just tried each 10 times in head avg: 1.53sec; out loud avg :1.68sec
2017-07-09 14:42:38,You didnt still go to bederwood?
2017-07-14 01:42:59,"If your foot still hurts but you still want to do a workout I'd say theres two options. 1. Go slow on an easy run to let your foot recover and then try to do a workout the next day, maybe an abbreviated one or the 1' repeats so you can stop if need be easily.  2. Do a tempo. Tempos are good because you dont go as fast = less stress on foot, and since its continuous unlike the workout,  you still get a good benefit. My vote would be a tempo."
2017-07-14 01:44:40,But also ocerall my vote would be to recover
2017-07-22 01:45:17,Glad you're back 😚
2017-07-27 19:19:47,I am proud of you
2017-07-28 20:21:26,20 more miles
2017-08-01 16:09:00,I see your bathroom/water stop 
2017-08-03 19:54:43,Classic apple watch
2017-08-05 14:31:59,Do you have a timeline on when you get to start running full time again?
2017-08-06 00:17:08,I would personally move straight to the amphetamines 
2017-08-07 16:27:57,Running > biking
2017-08-07 16:50:40,"True. Go get a free week long trial at a gym, i did that a couple summers ago "
2017-08-07 16:52:32,Stationary bike? Thats probably too miserable though
2017-08-07 17:02:39,I thought the pedal broke off?
2017-08-07 17:02:59,Spooky
2017-08-10 17:21:52,"Ive always believed the multiple pace peaks is because the watch is either bad at pace transitions or bad at fast pace. Not because of actual pace, just my hypothesis though "
2017-08-11 02:42:15,Did the luce line flood or what is going on?
2017-08-12 18:55:35,this was actually a 50 mile bike ride though....

2018-08-01 01:00:27,Ty for profile pic
2018-08-01 20:11:48,Basically it takes weight off of your body either through the use of a vacuum (the nice ones) or bungees (the one that we have) and because of that you land with less force on your legs. It allows people with stress-related injuries to keep running without doing damage to their injury. I used it to give my legs some rest while still working the muscles that normally get worked while running.
2018-08-02 13:24:53,Pedestal!
